    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The most delicious pie out there.</p> 
    <p>It is a combination between a sweet flavour and a light and creamy texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 sheet refrigerated pie pastry</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided</li>
      <li>1-3/4 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>1-1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Separate one egg. In a small bowl, lightly beat egg white; set aside. In another small bowl, combine egg and egg yolk; set aside.</li>
      <li>On a lightly floured surface, unroll pastry; cut in half. Roll out one half of pastry into an 8-in. circle. Transfer to a 7-in. pie plate; trim pastry even with edge. Brush with egg white; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the cheeses, confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, salt and egg mixture. Pour into prepared pastry.</li>
      <li>Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry. Brush remaining egg white over pastry; sprinkle with remaining cinnamon.</li>
      <li>Bake at 350Â° for 45-50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely on wire rack. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
    </ol>
